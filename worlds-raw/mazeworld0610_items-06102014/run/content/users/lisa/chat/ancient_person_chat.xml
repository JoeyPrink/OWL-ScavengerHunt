        <questiontext>Which secrets do I have to uncover?</questiontext>
        <answertext>There are statues hidden in the pyramid. Each depicts an ancient god of Egypt. Listen closely, and they will tell you their stories.</answertext>

        <questiontext>Thank you. Can you give me some more advice? </questiontext>
        <answertext>The pyramid also has some secret passages. Sometimes when you turn while your avatar is standing beneath a wall you can get a glimpse at them. Place yourself in front of a wall and run (by pressing shift and the up key) to get into these secret passageways.</answertext>

        <questiontext>Thank you. Can you give me some more advice? </questiontext>
        <answertext>I fear the rest is up to you. Try to find all the statues and discover the secrets of the gods they depict. Ah, and try switching between the third person and the first person view when navigating inside a small space becomes confusing.</answertext>

        <questiontext>You should really fix some issues in this game!</questiontext>
        <answertext>Maybe we'll do that in a future version. Or rather the developers will. After all, I'm still a NPC...</answertext>
