  <content>Horus was the son of Isis and Osiris. He was hidden by his mother in a thicket of papyrus in the Nile Delta when he was young because Isis feared the wroth of Seth, who wished to murder young Horus. As he grew older, Horus became Seth's rival for the throne. After a long battle he managed to defeat him with a falcon-headed staff and became the rightful king of Egypt.</content>
