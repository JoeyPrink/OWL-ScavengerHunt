  <title>Anubis</title>
  <content>Anubis was the son of Osiris and Nephthys. Out of fear for her husband Seth, Nephthys brought Anubis secretly to the world and abandoned him immediately after birth. Wild dogs found Anubis and raised him amongst them. He was later found by his aunt Isis and helped her to mummify the body of dead Osiris, so that he could move into the Underworld.</content>
